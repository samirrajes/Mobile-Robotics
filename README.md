# Mobile Robotics Labs

This repository contains a series of mobile robotics labs using ROS2, simulated in RViz and Gazebo. These labs explore fundamental concepts in mobile robotics, including sensor integration, control, and navigation strategies.

## Labs Overview

- **Turtlebot3 Motion:** Implements basic motion control for the Turtlebot3, allowing for movement in predefined paths.
- **Square Mover:** Commands the robot to move in a square path, testing basic movement commands and path-following accuracy.
- **Laser Scanning and Obstacle Avoidance:** Utilizes the robot's laser scanner to detect obstacles, avoiding collisions by adjusting the robot's path in real-time.
- **Wall Following:** Controls the robot to follow along walls, maintaining a set distance using sensor feedback.
- **PD Control:** Implements Proportional-Derivative (PD) control for smooth and responsive control, optimizing trajectory and reducing oscillations.
- **Noise Addition:** Simulates sensor noise to test the robustness of control algorithms in noisy environments.
